# ğŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Sam

I'm a designer-developer who loves building clean, fast, and useful web things.

- ğŸ›  I turn ideas into working products â€” fast.
- ğŸ§  I write about AI, design, and indie hacking.
- ğŸ’¡ Always chasing that sweet spot between simple and smart.

This is my GitHub profile â€” a mix of experiments, tools, and whatever I'm curious about at the moment.
